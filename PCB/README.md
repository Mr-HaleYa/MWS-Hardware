## V1.0
The first version with 4 short circuits and the wrong ping was assigned to the Ultrasonic sensor, and a lot of the pins were backward... 

## V1.1
Improved the routes, thickened the charging traces, added some more Silk Screen Decals, and fixed polarity issues.

##### Added
- 4 Battery pack
- option to use Pre-Fab DHT11
- MPPT heat cutout
- Company LOGO

##### Fixed
- Short Circuits 
- corrected Sensor pin
- polarity of pins

## V1.2
Changed the pins that power the board to use the pins on the back of the TTGO so we have all battery protections that are included. Altered the MPPT heat cutout to have a second small PCB built inside of it with small bridges so it can be removed and used as the temp sensor for the Ultrasonic Sensor.

##### Added 
- Connectors for battery pad on the back of ttgo
- Backward battery protection
- overcharge Protection
- Over-Discharge protection
- 3A overcurrent protection
- on/off switch
- 0.96" or 1.3" OLED Debug screen
- Debug_S or Debug_F jumper headers
- SMD resistor options
- Mini PCB in MPPT cutout

##### Fixed
- location of terminal blocks 
- grounding of solar pins
- grounding of MPPT
- battery pack orientation
