## V1.0
The first version with 4 short circuits and the wrong ping was assigned to the Ultrasonic sensor, and a lot of the pins were backward... 

## V1.1
Improved the routes, thickened the charging traces, added some more Silk Screen Decals, and fixed polarity issues.

##### Added
- 4 Battery pack
- option to use Pre-Fab DHT11
- MPPT heat cutout
- Company LOGO

##### Fixed
- Short Circuits 
- corrected Sensor pin
- polarity of pins

## V1.2
Changed the pins that power the board to use the pins on the back of the TTGO so we have all battery protections that are included. Altered the MPPT heat cutout to have a second small PCB be built inside of it with small bridges so it can be removed and used as the temp sensor for the Ultrasonic Sensor.

##### Added 
- Connectors for battery pads on the back of ttgo
- Backward battery protection
- overcharge Protection
- Over-Discharge protection
- 3A overcurrent protection
- on/off switch
- 0.96" OLED Debug screen
- SMD resistor options
- Mini PCB in MPPT cutout
- chip to force MCU off if Bat <2.7v
- debug screen
- Male headers to choose between debug modes
- 

##### Fixed
- location of terminal blocks
